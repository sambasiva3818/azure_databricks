What is DataFrame?
- DataFrame apperead in Spark 1.3
- It is a Dataset organized into named columns
- It is similar to the table in relational database or data frames in R/Python - Pandas

Why DataFrame?
- It's one step ahead of RDD.
- Sice it provides memory management and optimized execution plan.

Custom Memory Management: This is also known as Project Tungsten.
- A lot of memory is saved as the data is stored in off-heap memory in binary format.
- Apart from this, these is no Garbage Collection overhead.
- Expensive Java serialization is also avoided.

Optimized Execution Plan: This is also known as the query optimizer.
Using this, an optimized execution plan is created for the execution of a query. Once the Optimized plan is created final execution takes place on RDDs of Spark.

Features of Spark DataFrame?
- Supports for various data formats like Hive, CSV, XML, JSON, RDDs, Casandra, Parquet etc
- Supports for integration with various Big Data tools.
- Catalyst optimizer for efficient data processing across multiple languages.
- Custom memory management to reduce overload and improve performance compared to RDDs.
- APIs for Java, R, Python, and Spark.

Limitations?
- DataFrame API does not have provision for compile time type safety.
- If the structure is unknown, we cannot manipulate the data.
